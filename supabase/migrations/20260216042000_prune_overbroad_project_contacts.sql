-- Migration: Prune over-broad project_contacts rows that poison attribution
-- Owner: DATA-2 (WP-3a data quality fix, world-model-sprint)
-- Date: 2026-02-16
--
-- Problem: 119 rows with source='data_inferred' mapped 10 subcontractors to ALL 12 projects.
-- This defeated context-assembly SOURCE 1 (project_contacts lookup) by spraying 12 equal-weight
-- candidates (0.22 each) instead of discriminating by real association.
-- Example: Brian Dove mapped to 12 projects when GT says Woodbery framing only.
--
-- Additionally, 8 null-source rows for Dwayne Brown had the same spray pattern.
--
-- Fix: Delete these fabricated spray rows. Real signal lives in:
--   - correspondent_project_affinity (SOURCE 2, interaction-weighted)
--   - v_contact_project_affinity view (call-count based affinity percentages)
--   - Remaining project_contacts rows with evidence-backed sources
--
-- Impact: 127 rows deleted. Remaining project_contacts: 135 rows with evidence-backed sources.
-- After cleanup, contact_fanout refreshed to reflect accurate fanout classifications.
--
-- Affected contacts (data_inferred, 10 contacts x ~12 projects each):
--   Zach Givens, Brandon Hightower, Brian Dove, Eric Atkinson, Flynt Treadaway,
--   Gatlin Hawkins, Malcolm Hetzer, Randy Booth, Taylor Shannon, Anthony Cottrell
--
-- Affected contacts (null source, 1 contact x 8 projects):
--   Dwayne Brown (retained: 1 gmail_research row for Skelton Residence = correct GT)

-- Step 1: Delete data_inferred spray rows
DELETE FROM public.project_contacts WHERE source = 'data_inferred';

-- Step 2: Delete null-source spray rows
DELETE FROM public.project_contacts WHERE source IS NULL;

-- Step 3: Refresh contact_fanout from interaction + affinity data
