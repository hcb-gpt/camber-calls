-- Migration: Fix review_queue.interaction_id type mismatch
-- Purpose: Change interaction_id from uuid to text to match interactions table
-- Date: 2026-01-31
--
-- ROOT CAUSE: interactions.interaction_id is TEXT (e.g., 'cll_06DSX0CVZHZK72VCVW54EH9G3C')
--             but review_queue.interaction_id was UUID, causing silent insert failures
--             when ai-router tries to queue items for review.
--
-- SAFETY: This matches the fix applied to override_log in migration 20260131141500

-- Step 1: Drop dependent view
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v_review_queue_spans;

-- Step 2: Drop any foreign key constraint if it exists
ALTER TABLE review_queue DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS review_queue_interaction_id_fkey;

-- Step 3: Change column type from uuid to text
ALTER TABLE review_queue
  ALTER COLUMN interaction_id TYPE text
  USING interaction_id::text;

-- Step 4: Add comment documenting the column
COMMENT ON COLUMN review_queue.interaction_id IS
  'Text interaction_id (matches interactions.interaction_id format, e.g., cll_06DSX0CVZHZK72VCVW54EH9G3C)';

-- Step 5: Recreate the view with updated join logic
-- Note: interactions.interaction_id is TEXT, so we join on that instead of i.id (uuid)
