# Desktop cleanup manifest

This folder is a staging bundle to move high-value Desktop artifacts into GitHub.

## Contents
- `docs_html/`: Camber desktop HTML docs (current/final/gap/scorecard/pipeline diagram)
- `datasets/`: GT labeling + phase + rerun batch list + homeowner proofset + anchor catalog
- `notes_fixes/`: working notes and candidate fix SQL/TS drafts used during GT work

## Source
Copied from `/Users/chadbarlow/Desktop` on 2026-02-15.

## Next step
A DEV session should:
1) Add these into the appropriate repo locations (likely `orbit/docs/...` for HTML and `camber-calls/artifacts/...` for datasets)
2) Commit + push with a clear message
3) Reply with Git SHAs
