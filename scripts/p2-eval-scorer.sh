# p2-eval-scorer.sh — P2 Statistical Evaluation Framework
# Computes paired A/B comparison of P0 vs P1 attribution accuracy.
# Outputs: McNemar's test, stratified accuracy, confidence intervals, regression check.
#
# Usage:
#   ./p2-eval-scorer.sh                    # Score all labeled calls with v1.7.0 attributions
#   ./p2-eval-scorer.sh --blind-trial-only # Score only the 3 blind trial calls
#   ./p2-eval-scorer.sh --call-ids FILE    # Score specific call_ids from a file (one per line)
#   ./p2-eval-scorer.sh --json             # Output JSON instead of human-readable
#
# Requires: SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (from credentials.env)
# Author: DATA-4 (data-4)
