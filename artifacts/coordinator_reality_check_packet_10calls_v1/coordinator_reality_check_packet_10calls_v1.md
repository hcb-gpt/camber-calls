```text
0001 | SPEAKER_0: Hi.
0002 | SPEAKER_1: Hey. Okay. So I got so I got a little bit of information.
0003 | SPEAKER_1: So, basically,
0004 | SPEAKER_1: one thing she was able to notice that is missing that Aaron needs to submit, I guess there's a checklist that's from 2025.
0005 | SPEAKER_1: And then because he's just recently submitted 2026,
0006 | SPEAKER_1: you literally have to go in and get the new 2026 checklist,
0007 | SPEAKER_1: check it off, and resubmit that. So she gave me Jake, who's our reviewer. She gave me his email, and she said email it directly to him and have him print it and put it in our file.
0008 | SPEAKER_1: Another thing she said is that, I guess, our reviewer is,
0009 | SPEAKER_1: disabled, and so he has not been coming into the office.
0010 | SPEAKER_1: And our plans are sitting in his office. So, basically,
0011 | SPEAKER_1: until he comes into the office,
0012 | SPEAKER_1: we are kind of sitting and waiting.
0013 | SPEAKER_1: Wow. So
0014 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah. I was like, please let me know if you'd like me to pick the plans up and take him to his house because I'd have to do that. Right. And she was very friendly, and she did her best to kinda help. And she said some counties will let you have a contingency on getting the thing submitted, but I guess Oconee is not one of them. Yeah. They
0015 | SPEAKER_0: Oconee's been
0016 | SPEAKER_0: I mean, I don't know if they've been helpful, but they're fully aware of it. I mean, I've gone two or three times now to ask, like, is there some roundabout
0017 | SPEAKER_0: that I can do to get started on-site work?
0018 | SPEAKER_0: And, basically, they said that, you know, that that there's nothing they can do because they can't let me grade without state erosion.
0019 | SPEAKER_1: Right.
0020 | SPEAKER_0: So that's what she told me I could put a construction driveway in, but that's really just the the first, like, 20 foot entrance, like, that gravel
0021 | SPEAKER_0: entrance. Yeah.
0022 | SPEAKER_0: It's not really probably worth your time getting that happening yet. More of them. Yeah. It's like, you know, something they don't they would charge me more to come do it now than
0023 | SPEAKER_0: Right. To just do it when we started.
0024 | SPEAKER_0: Yeah. Okay. So it's just that the only thing really that she could
0025 | SPEAKER_0: notate is we need to give the new updated checklist then because now it's just.
0026 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah. She said that, and then she said whatever else was written on that most recent,
0027 | SPEAKER_1: you know,
0028 | SPEAKER_1: failing or whatever. She's like, she didn't necessarily understand because she's not a plan reviewer.
0029 | SPEAKER_1: But, yeah, she basically said our plans are sitting on his desk, and he's
0030 | SPEAKER_1: they they were not, they were not of the selection that he took home for the ice storm,
0031 | SPEAKER_1: which kinda pisses me off. But
0032 | SPEAKER_1: Right. She basically said, as soon as he comes in, it should be done. But she's like, you know, he can't come in because he's disabled, but I'm not sure why he can't come in now. But, you know, it's not gonna help that it's about to snow again because it'll just keep getting pushed back. So but she kinda said, like, as soon as she sees them, she'll tell them to get it done.
0033 | SPEAKER_1: But
0034 | SPEAKER_0: Okay.
0035 | SPEAKER_1: But I do have an email now.
0036 | SPEAKER_0: Yeah. If you can, do you mind texting me just the, I guess, the
0037 | SPEAKER_0: email and then just the fact that,
0038 | SPEAKER_0: that we need to he needs to send a new checklist.
0039 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah. And I guess it's whatever
0040 | SPEAKER_1: yeah. Whatever. It just has to have the new year on it. So I guess it's the exact same checklist.
0041 | SPEAKER_1: It just needs to be updated with the year. And then she said make sure she he emails it directly to Jake
0042 | SPEAKER_1: and, you know, says that it needs to be printed and put in our file.
0043 | SPEAKER_0: Okay.
0044 | SPEAKER_1: So, yeah, I'll send you this right here.
0045 | SPEAKER_0: Okay. Well, I'm driving right now, but I'll call Aaron then with at least that bit of information.
0046 | SPEAKER_0: And Okay. Maybe that at least gives us an explanation of why. Well, it gives an explanation. It's not a good reason, but Right. That's why they didn't review on Monday,
0047 | SPEAKER_0: for Tuesday or Wednesday.
0048 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah. That's what because that's what I'd asked her. I said it was supposed to be reviewed on Tuesday. She said, oh, yeah. He's disabled. He can't come in.
0049 | SPEAKER_1: And I said and then I kind of, like, kindly asked, can they work from home? And she said, yes. They yours was not one of the ones that was taken, your files.
0050 | SPEAKER_1: But she did feel hopeful that as soon as she sees him, he'll get it. She'll, like, tell him to get it done. So
0051 | SPEAKER_1: Okay.
0052 | SPEAKER_1: Should that be the case? I have no idea, but she may have just been telling me what I wanna hear. This, like, crazy? I mean Isn't this, like, a
0053 | SPEAKER_1: just it's not necessary. Leaving. Right. It's I was talking to somebody else with another it it's just like anything in public public service is tough. Right.
0054 | SPEAKER_0: Well So and I was talking to the engineer about it, and he was like
0055 | SPEAKER_0: he was like, you know,
0056 | SPEAKER_0: he said that he's never
0057 | SPEAKER_0: had one turned down this many times. But
0058 | SPEAKER_0: he's like, it's just crazy that this is is, like that they're holding us to such a strict
0059 | SPEAKER_0: erosion plan to where, like, it's not like I'm developing a 100 acres.
0060 | SPEAKER_0: Right. I would have to be grossly incompetent to even
0061 | SPEAKER_0: do anything that would make an effect on, like, like, an erosion issue.
0062 | SPEAKER_0: You know, I I I don't even know what I could do in a small lot like that.
0063 | SPEAKER_0: So but he said to me
0064 | SPEAKER_0: he was like, you know, the only way that any of this can be changed
0065 | SPEAKER_0: is on a legislative
0066 | SPEAKER_0: level, and not that I'm gonna have any pull to do it. But I do know you know, I'm part of the Home Builders Association,
0067 | SPEAKER_0: and there is, like, a representative who's part of the Home Builders. I don't know how, but I called him yesterday, and I was like, man, I know that this is, like, probably not your thing, but I said something needs to be done as as far as erosion plans and and and residential construction,
0068 | SPEAKER_0: because it's wild. Like, this is absolutely
0069 | SPEAKER_0: crazy that that it's gonna I mean, we're three months now
0070 | SPEAKER_0: in waiting for them.
0071 | SPEAKER_1: Right. And especially in, like, a small county
0072 | SPEAKER_1: with a Right. I don't know. It seems like
0073 | SPEAKER_1: I can understand city of Atlanta with all the historic and the this and the that and whatever. I don't even know that. I mean, it has to do with erosion, but I don't know. It just seems
0074 | SPEAKER_1: they're wasting everyone's time and resources. I mean,
0075 | SPEAKER_1: so much could have been accomplished by now.
0076 | SPEAKER_1: I mean,
0077 | SPEAKER_1: it's not the end of the world. It's just annoying that, like, I I you know, you don't expect everything to be quick and done, and I get that. And that's part of the process, but
0078 | SPEAKER_0: just get your job done. This yeah. This this is, like, way excessive. I mean, the only and and, yeah, I mean, we could've got a lot like, the past two weeks, we probably wouldn't have been able to do a ton if we were doing dirt because of weather. But, you know, before
0079 | SPEAKER_0: but we've still
0080 | SPEAKER_0: this shouldn't take three months. Like, you know, that only accounts for less than a third of of the time when we've been speaking.
0081 | SPEAKER_1: Has this all been sitting with
0082 | SPEAKER_1: has the erosion stuff all been sitting with this for three months? This has all been the erosion guy?
0083 | SPEAKER_0: Yeah. The permit? We've done three different yeah. This per the permits,
0084 | SPEAKER_0: we've submitted everything to Oconee County, but they won't even put it up for review
0085 | SPEAKER_0: is what they say to me until the state
0086 | SPEAKER_0: releases the erosion plan. Now all that being said, Oconee County is top they, like, know
0087 | SPEAKER_0: that we've failed this. So I'm hoping that, you know, once it comes to the state that they'll just say,
0088 | SPEAKER_0: hey. Look. You know, you're you're,
0089 | SPEAKER_0: you know, we're bumping you to the front of the line.
0090 | SPEAKER_0: Right. The only thing that the county has given me
0091 | SPEAKER_0: any
0092 | SPEAKER_0: any, I guess, input on as far as your building permit,
0093 | SPEAKER_0: is the septic permit,
0094 | SPEAKER_0: you know, you had or I don't know if you gave it to us or Chad found it, but
0095 | SPEAKER_0: somewhere in maybe your closing documents.
0096 | SPEAKER_0: But we had we found record of
0097 | SPEAKER_0: your lot with with tested soils on it. Yeah.
0098 | SPEAKER_0: And so
0099 | SPEAKER_0: we handed that in for the septic.
0100 | SPEAKER_0: They said to us that when, you know, when push comes to shove, they might ask us to test a little bit more because your septic
0101 | SPEAKER_0: I can show you on that plan, but your septic system is, like, on the edge of how far they they tested.
0102 | SPEAKER_0: So we might need to test just a little bit more of a section, but that I mean, I I told Chad it's probably worth it to just go ahead and get it done, but that's not holding us up in in any aspect of you know?
0103 | SPEAKER_0: So
0104 | SPEAKER_0: but, yeah, the county I mean, they won't they won't release anything. I don't know. They won't let me know if they review it. From my understanding,
0105 | SPEAKER_0: they won't review a permanent document until the state releases the corrosion plan.
0106 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah. That's what she was saying. Some counties, you can do it on contingency, but a county is not one of them.
0107 | SPEAKER_1: Which Yep. Maybe they should readjust that because they're probably gonna have a lot of I mean, people are moving out of town and
0108 | SPEAKER_1: just one of the areas people are probably moving. So either there's gonna be a backlog
0109 | SPEAKER_1: or
0110 | SPEAKER_1: I don't know. The
0111 | SPEAKER_0: when I was in I went into Oconee County yesterday to talk about it with them again,
0112 | SPEAKER_0: and
0113 | SPEAKER_0: I kinda chuckled, and I said, I'm sure you know what I'm here about.
0114 | SPEAKER_0: And she said that I she goes, you and about five other builders
0115 | SPEAKER_0: who have been waiting for the state to release it. She said, we're not the only ones failing.
0116 | SPEAKER_1: But Well, that's good news. I
0117 | SPEAKER_1: mean, annoying. Yeah. But I'm glad we're out of them.
0118 | SPEAKER_0: Yep.
0119 | SPEAKER_0: But it's just like
0120 | SPEAKER_0: from from what the engineers told me is that
0121 | SPEAKER_0: he's like, that office has so much turnover
0122 | SPEAKER_0: that they just he said that he thinks they hire people on, like, a temp worker basis.
0123 | SPEAKER_0: And so that those guys, like, have no like, they don't really have work experience. And he said, so the way that
0124 | SPEAKER_0: the guidelines of of the way that those plans are drawn,
0125 | SPEAKER_0: he said the guidelines are the same for
0126 | SPEAKER_0: whatever, a gas station next to a
0127 | SPEAKER_0: a lake as they are for a, you know, a small lot in a neighborhood.
0128 | SPEAKER_0: So Really? That, you know, that guy's looking at it as, like, a black and white.
0129 | SPEAKER_0: You know, there is no in between.
0130 | SPEAKER_1: There's no case by case
0131 | SPEAKER_0: basis. That that's what the engineer said. Now I don't all this stuff is kind of foreign to me because I don't really get involved with
0132 | SPEAKER_0: this is you know, it's just odd that this is being
0133 | SPEAKER_0: but so
0134 | SPEAKER_0: he told me that, like, in the past, like, he said, like, things that they're commenting on
0135 | SPEAKER_0: should have no bearing on on a residential
0136 | SPEAKER_0: erosion plan.
0137 | SPEAKER_0: And he was like, you know, any seasoned reviewer or anyone who's done it a couple times would obviously be able to say, like, hey. This is a residential.
0138 | SPEAKER_0: Not really not that big of a deal
0139 | SPEAKER_0: compared to, you know, large commercial development. It but he said that this guy just doesn't seem to be willing
0140 | SPEAKER_0: to, like, have that conversation.
0141 | SPEAKER_1: Well, it almost seems like if you fail at once, they should give it to a new reviewer for the second review so you have fresh eyes. Because to me, it's like, he's just seeing what he's already done and,
0142 | SPEAKER_1: you know, ding, ding, ding, whatever.
0143 | SPEAKER_1: I don't know. It just doesn't it seems like a flawed system, which is the case in a lot of government situations. But Yep.
0144 | SPEAKER_1: Maybe that'll be my next year fixing the government.
0145 | SPEAKER_0: Yeah. That's right.
0146 | SPEAKER_1: All the time in the world.
0147 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah. That's right. Bless. So Well, she was super nice and, like, hopefully
0148 | SPEAKER_1: I mean, hopefully, the guy will
0149 | SPEAKER_1: at least see the I don't know. Get into the office. I don't I just think that's shitty. I I guess I don't want that, you know, I don't want it to slip and fall. I get that. But, like, bro, you've been out since
0150 | SPEAKER_1: last week. Well,
0151 | SPEAKER_0: yeah. And and we're we're kinda well past the the
0152 | SPEAKER_0: dangers of weather. I I feel like I I don't know. One would think.
0153 | SPEAKER_1: One would think. But, also, why why wouldn't these can these, like, housing documents not be a digital option? Like, she said he didn't take ours with him.
0154 | SPEAKER_1: Do you know? Is it, like do they do they print out and, like, look at a paper pencil kinda situation?
0155 | SPEAKER_0: They must review it in hard copy. I mean, yeah. They don't even ask us to like, we can't even upload it.
0156 | SPEAKER_0: It it has to be
0157 | SPEAKER_0: so, like, the in your scenario, because we are trying to just
0158 | SPEAKER_0: get it done so quick, the engineer
0159 | SPEAKER_0: went to the Athens office to deliver it.
0160 | SPEAKER_0: That technically and I didn't know this,
0161 | SPEAKER_0: but Oconee County told me we're not technically supposed to do that. I'm supposed to deliver it to whatever the county is,
0162 | SPEAKER_0: and then they send it from there.
0163 | SPEAKER_0: But it's all done on hard copy. You know, I the Oconee County told me they said that has no
0164 | SPEAKER_0: impact in in your timing or or the review process. They just said, you know, going forward, you're not supposed to do that.
0165 | SPEAKER_0: I think the engineer was just trying to help help me out. But Sure.
0166 | SPEAKER_0: But, yeah, I mean, it it's it's completely wild. I don't know. The the whole thing, I I I I don't understand it.
0167 | SPEAKER_0: But
0168 | SPEAKER_1: We're just gonna keep our fingers crossed because this is the longest part of the process.
0169 | SPEAKER_1: Well, that's all I have. Yeah. Happened.
0170 | SPEAKER_0: Yeah. That's right. It it certainly as far as the
0171 | SPEAKER_0: how little is getting done in in such a long period of time, it's certainly the longest phase. I mean, you know, we'll the house will be framed in in a shorter time period
0172 | SPEAKER_0: than this, you know, permit is taking.
0173 | SPEAKER_0: Yeah. Well,
0174 | SPEAKER_1: at least we have some information
0175 | SPEAKER_1: to go off of and one thing we can fix, which be is the checklist. So
0176 | SPEAKER_1: that makes looks like we accomplished something. Okay.
0177 | SPEAKER_0: So Yep. That's right.
0178 | SPEAKER_1: And then Well Yeah. Like I said, she doesn't know anything else, but at least we can get that checklist in, I guess.
0179 | SPEAKER_1: Okay.
0180 | SPEAKER_0: So Alright. Well, that sounds good.
0181 | SPEAKER_1: Alright. Thank you.
0182 | SPEAKER_0: Thank you.

0001 | SPEAKER_0: Hey, Randy.
0002 | SPEAKER_1: Hey, man. You ain't gonna believe what that was.
0003 | SPEAKER_1: It was the bank. I'd went by and cashed a check. Right?
0004 | SPEAKER_0: Yeah.
0005 | SPEAKER_1: And she says,
0006 | SPEAKER_1: I balanced my my my my my, whatever, drawer right before you came in.
0007 | SPEAKER_1: And now I'm balancing. I'm a thousand short. So
0008 | SPEAKER_1: did you happen to have a extra thousand? I said, well, I don't know. I'll stop at the store and count it. And so I counted it. No. I didn't have a extra thousand. So
0009 | SPEAKER_1: but, yes, she said, well, I brought a thousand short, and she says, I had balanced it right before you came in. She said, so it had to be from you, you know, at $4.03 in the last thirty minutes. It had to be. I said, okay.
0010 | SPEAKER_1: How about that?
0011 | SPEAKER_1: I was no help to her. I wish I would've been.
0012 | SPEAKER_0: Be. Yeah. Well, that's no good.
0013 | SPEAKER_1: No. But, you know, that don't happen very often. It's probably hard for her to to start calling people and asking.
0014 | SPEAKER_0: Yeah. Which it also makes me wonder maybe she just got in a panic and maybe miscounted a little bit too.
0015 | SPEAKER_1: That's what I'm thinking. Yeah. But I was pretty sure mine was right because as she was counting, you know, I'm listening and I'm counting the bills as she flips them through. You know? Right.
0016 | SPEAKER_1: And so I was pretty sure she counted mine right.
0017 | SPEAKER_1: Yep. And
0018 | SPEAKER_1: But I recounted just just to make sure.
0019 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah.
0020 | SPEAKER_1: But that's Truist. Have you ever dealt with Truist?
0021 | SPEAKER_0: No. But, you know,
0022 | SPEAKER_0: I was talking to my dad the other day, and he was saying to go with the Truist,
0023 | SPEAKER_0: but I'm thinking about playing hardball with the bank a little bit. Not that anyone's done me any wrong,
0024 | SPEAKER_0: but,
0025 | SPEAKER_0: you know, I I I wanna build a bigger shop down by the road at at my house there right next to Damon.
0026 | SPEAKER_0: And,
0027 | SPEAKER_0: you know, I I
0028 | SPEAKER_0: don't really wanna you know, I don't know if I get a equity loan on it, but, technically,
0029 | SPEAKER_0: an equity line, I think you're supposed to live in that house, I guess, be your primary residence.
0030 | SPEAKER_1: Right. Yeah.
0031 | SPEAKER_0: So but my dad said to me he said, man, he said,
0032 | SPEAKER_0: go talk to a couple banks.
0033 | SPEAKER_0: And
0034 | SPEAKER_0: because he said, you know, yeah, you're not a huge
0035 | SPEAKER_0: player in the in the grand scheme of it. And he said, but your your business account
0036 | SPEAKER_0: still moves enough money through it. He said that you're still valuable to a bank.
0037 | SPEAKER_0: And he says, see if one of them won't won't work on it with you.
0038 | SPEAKER_0: And he said, you know, I use United for everything. My they got my personal and my business. And he said, so give them the chance. And he said, and then you walk across the street and you go over to Bank of Madison, and you give them the chance. And he said, it Yeah. You know, he said it's bankers. I mean, you don't have to be all that loyal to either of them. And he said, see which one's gonna give you the you know, give them what you want. And he said, tell them, you know, that you're you'd be happy to pull all your money out and bring it somewhere else if you have to.
0039 | SPEAKER_1: So Yep.
0040 | SPEAKER_0: I I am thinking about doing that because, you know, Damon was telling me he said, well, why don't you
0041 | SPEAKER_0: take out some sort of there's, like, an ag loan where you lease the barn for three years, and then you gotta pay it. But and it makes helps you write the barn off in three years, which that's all good and great, but I don't wanna have some huge payment.
0042 | SPEAKER_0: You know? I'd rather pay it off over twenty years and and not have a huge payment.
0043 | SPEAKER_1: That's right.
0044 | SPEAKER_1: So But now, you know, Damon knows,
0045 | SPEAKER_1: and I don't know. It's almost like Damon just about owns part of the daggone, you know, Bank of Madison up there. You know?
0046 | SPEAKER_1: I know they don't, but it it is kinda that way. You know?
0047 | SPEAKER_0: Yeah.
0048 | SPEAKER_1: What was the other day that it was something the other day. You know?
0049 | SPEAKER_1: And, and it was for Damon, you know, and and and Tim would get up, walk outside, and sign all the stuff for Damon to take it right back in, you know, so that the cameras wouldn't lock any sign in Damon's stuff, you know. I don't know.
0050 | SPEAKER_1: But, you know,
0051 | SPEAKER_1: it it gets loaded a lot like that.
0052 | SPEAKER_1: But I don't think Michael Madison cares, you know. If they do it, it's it's out of town. It's not necessarily because
0053 | SPEAKER_1: they really care. You know?
0054 | SPEAKER_0: Right.
0055 | SPEAKER_1: They're all good.
0056 | SPEAKER_0: I've got half of mind to switch stuff over to Bank of Madison because everybody I know that
0057 | SPEAKER_0: you know, most people I know that bank there have good things to say about them as far as they'll work with you on stuff. And not that United might not work with me, but I just I do like the idea of it being a bunch of people that, for the most part, if I don't know them, somebody I do knows them. And Yeah. You know, I I I do like that.
0058 | SPEAKER_1: We have good luck with Bank of Madison. I really feel like
0059 | SPEAKER_1: my account is my money is safe there now
0060 | SPEAKER_1: because
0061 | SPEAKER_1: Gabby went and bought new tires for her car. You know?
0062 | SPEAKER_0: Yeah.
0063 | SPEAKER_1: So, Monday morning,
0064 | SPEAKER_1: The lady from the bank account. Mister Brian said we we have a a debit for Augusta, Georgia at the such and such place. Did y'all make that charge? Yes. That was my wife's charge.
0065 | SPEAKER_1: You know, that
0066 | SPEAKER_0: that's pretty good. Yeah. That means yeah. That means a lot.
0067 | SPEAKER_1: And,
0068 | SPEAKER_1: now sometimes and I I really think if you ever got to spend a lot of money, Tim would shut her card down, so she wouldn't spend any more money too, by the way.
0069 | SPEAKER_0: Yeah. Well, that's a good thing too.
0070 | SPEAKER_1: And, Carl, would tell you, Gavin spent a lot of money. So tell her there's a glitch in her card,
0071 | SPEAKER_1: and we'll get it fixed if you tell me it's okay.
0072 | SPEAKER_1: If not, that glitch is gonna stay there. Okay.
0073 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah.
0074 | SPEAKER_0: That's right.
0075 | SPEAKER_0: Yeah. So, yeah, I think I am gonna gonna gonna go talk to him about some of this stuff and and see if I can get and, you know, the other thing is is and I really like him and and I think he likes me pretty well is,
0076 | SPEAKER_0: you know,
0077 | SPEAKER_0: mister Floyd Newton, the one that we've done good bit of work for,
0078 | SPEAKER_0: he the last time we finished at the little house there in town, you know, at the big house, but when we did the little one there Right. On the same property,
0079 | SPEAKER_0: he said to me
0080 | SPEAKER_0: the same he said, you know,
0081 | SPEAKER_0: he said, I know you don't bank at Bank of Madison.
0082 | SPEAKER_0: And he said, I've never brought it up to you. And he said, but I'm on the board of of at the bank. And he said, you know, I'd be happy to talk with you about, you know, you switching your account over to us. So and, you know and again,
0083 | SPEAKER_0: not like I'm the biggest, you know,
0084 | SPEAKER_0: moving man around No. Madison. So the fact that he asked that, I thought, well, that's pretty cool. I, you know, I like that he he even brought that up to me.
0085 | SPEAKER_1: And what Gabby always says is
0086 | SPEAKER_1: all of back when those banks were failing, all of them little banks failed. You know? Almost all of them. Even the big banks had to get bailed out. But Little Bank of Madison didn't fail, and they did not get bailed out.
0087 | SPEAKER_1: But Bank of Madison,
0088 | SPEAKER_1: if they give you a loan and they supposed to go out and look where those big banks weren't sending people out to look, and those big builders were rolling in there and and drawing all the money on the whole subdivision
0089 | SPEAKER_1: and has not even built a house. You know? And they go to foreclose on 20 houses, and there's one in there. You know?
0090 | SPEAKER_1: I'll give them credit. That that tells him he'll get in the car and ride out there and look and make sure there's really a house there before he gives you all your money. You know?
0091 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah. I thought that made a difference too.
0092 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah. But,
0093 | SPEAKER_1: Yep. But, yes, they are I know and, you know, the Penningtons, they've got money with Truist, and they've got money with Bank of Madison. You know?
0094 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah. And they borrowed the money to build that big old house at the lake.
0095 | SPEAKER_1: So I asked Tim,
0096 | SPEAKER_1: Tim, why in the world would the Pennington's borrow money to build a house as much money as they've got?
0097 | SPEAKER_1: And he says, well, they needed the write off. And he said
0098 | SPEAKER_1: and we cut them a deal on the interest.
0099 | SPEAKER_1: I said, Tim, I didn't think you cut deals on interest. He says, well, he said, when the man's got three times the amount in the bank that they wanna borrow,
0100 | SPEAKER_1: any interest is better than no interest. I said, okay. That's that's right.
0101 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah. He said he said, any interest is better than no interest. I said, okay. Yeah.
0102 | SPEAKER_1: That's funny. But yeah. But now they've got they've got money to cut deals. We we, you know, we don't have that kind of money. But Yeah. We we, yeah, we don't have those bargaining chips, but that's alright.
0103 | SPEAKER_1: That's alright. But, yeah, I would ask them and see Truist. Truist is so big.
0104 | SPEAKER_1: I don't know. I don't think you'll like Truist. I'll take but, I mean, it's you can ask.
0105 | SPEAKER_1: But if you go to Truist, especially if you go to that Madison branch,
0106 | SPEAKER_1: you have got the Watson like a hawk
0107 | SPEAKER_1: because they may not be necessarily
0108 | SPEAKER_1: making a mistake,
0109 | SPEAKER_1: but they are making a mistake. You know? Let's say you wanna put 500 in this account, 200 in this one, and one in this one. You better check. It's all going in, but it may not be in the accounts you said it was. Do you know? It may not be where you asked it to go. Yeah. No.
0110 | SPEAKER_1: It's in your account, but it might not be on the one you thought it was going in. You know?
0111 | SPEAKER_0: Yeah. Yep.
0112 | SPEAKER_1: Or they'll they'll give me cashback, and I'm like, where'd the money come from?
0113 | SPEAKER_1: Well, you
0114 | SPEAKER_1: you you could get money back.
0115 | SPEAKER_1: Where from? Yeah. And you look through, and one of the deposit slips is sitting there. Oh, okay.
0116 | SPEAKER_1: And then, of course, they'll deposit. You know?
0117 | SPEAKER_0: Yeah. Right.
0118 | SPEAKER_0: Yeah.
0119 | SPEAKER_0: Well, yeah, I I like the small I'd much rather deal with a small bank. And I and, you know, to be honest with you, I've never had a really a bad experience with United Bank, but United is a little bit bigger. You know, I think United is basically it's just in I think Madison's as far north
0120 | SPEAKER_0: as United stretches. I think it's mainly South Georgia, isn't it?
0121 | SPEAKER_1: I think so. They've got a branch in Covington. I do know that.
0122 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah. Yeah. Because I stopped the other branch in '37.
0123 | SPEAKER_1: I
0124 | SPEAKER_0: opened with them is because I met when I first moved here, I met Nelson Hale early on. And I like Nelson. Yeah. And that's why I've never even asked about moving because I really do like Nelson.
0125 | SPEAKER_0: But, you know, I think that probably
0126 | SPEAKER_0: Bank of Madison
0127 | SPEAKER_0: I think there's probably more benefits for for someone like me at Bank of Madison than there is at United.
0128 | SPEAKER_1: Probably so.
0129 | SPEAKER_1: But I yeah. I've met Nelson. He's pretty cool.
0130 | SPEAKER_1: Matter of fact Yeah. We went on the fishing trip a couple years ago. You know, he went with us on the fishing trip or he goes on the fishing trip. You know? And I went with them. What's that like that? Anyway
0131 | SPEAKER_1: but, you know,
0132 | SPEAKER_1: I I wasn't in his circle, so,
0133 | SPEAKER_1: you know, I knew who he was. He probably didn't have a clue who I was. You know? But it's okay. Yeah.
0134 | SPEAKER_0: Well, he's not I mean, he's a nice guy. I I do like him, but,
0135 | SPEAKER_0: but, you know, the little bit of stuff I've kinda asked poked around with him,
0136 | SPEAKER_0: you know, I I think and I'm not saying I want somebody to not play by the rules, but I think the rules are a little bit more black and white at United than maybe they might be at at Bank of Madison.
0137 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah.
0138 | SPEAKER_1: Cool.
0139 | SPEAKER_0: So But But hey. But well, one thing I was thinking about the other day, Randy, because I just
0140 | SPEAKER_0: got a well drilled down there on Bethany Road down by the man's little wood shop, which I don't think you've ever even had to go down there really. But Uh-uh. I knew I knew you were thinking it was better
0141 | SPEAKER_1: to get a well or better to,
0142 | SPEAKER_1: you know, pipe it down there. You know?
0143 | SPEAKER_0: Yeah. Which in the long run, I don't know. I guess we probably saved him something maybe, but we ended up having to drill almost 600 feet. But he's got himself a good well now. He's got 13 gallons a minute down there. But, Oh, yeah. That is good well.
0144 | SPEAKER_0: Yeah. But,
0145 | SPEAKER_0: but, you know,
0146 | SPEAKER_0: probably sooner than later because I I'm
0147 | SPEAKER_0: the floor guys were supposed to go back tomorrow, but I'm gonna be sanding and or, you know, staining and first coating
0148 | SPEAKER_0: my floors there. Yeah. But before too long, you
0149 | SPEAKER_0: know, it might not be a bad idea while the weld company is there. I told them I want them to go ahead and straighten us out with
0150 | SPEAKER_0: all these multiple pressure tanks and switches we got all over on the house in the little shed.
0151 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah.
0152 | SPEAKER_0: So
0153 | SPEAKER_0: before too long, it might be nice to to go ahead and get that house pressurized
0154 | SPEAKER_0: and get the old house operational again and
0155 | SPEAKER_0: just so I can Yeah. You know? Unless you're I guess, if you wanted to, we could do it all on the trim, but it might be nice to kinda break it up and get pressure on the house all at once, you know, beforehand.
0156 | SPEAKER_1: You know, I thought about that whenever you mentioned it the other day. I thought and, you know, I'm wanting to say I don't have anything really pressing me Monday or Tuesday, which Monday, if we get five inches of snowman, I'm taking off Monday. I go and tell you. I just ain't gonna believe it. So I'll take off just as I have to mess my slow man myself. You know?
0157 | SPEAKER_0: That's right.
0158 | SPEAKER_1: But, yeah, Steve's got a little job for me to start up on Wednesday, but she's not like, I don't think I got and there's probably somebody, but I don't think anybody's pressing me on Monday and Tuesday. That's kinda like Spartan, I thought. You know, I get that done. I had all kind of little stuff I got done this week. But from Right. You know, that stuff that you've had on the list for months to do, and and it's the first time you ever kinda see that to do.
0159 | SPEAKER_0: I sure do.
0160 | SPEAKER_1: One guy.
0161 | SPEAKER_1: But Not that he really needed it.
0162 | SPEAKER_1: But but yeah. So maybe Monday or Tuesday one, and that's close. I won't have to travel far to do it.
0163 | SPEAKER_1: I need to figure out how to get water.
0164 | SPEAKER_1: Is but there's water connected to the a new part in there or not?
0165 | SPEAKER_0: Well, I know I think that
0166 | SPEAKER_0: yeah. I think that the you know, your dad's got he's connected, but I think he I think he's just got that supply stuffed into the foundation.
0167 | SPEAKER_0: So I don't think it's ever I think where your main connection is, you know, they're they're right close to each other, but I don't think we ever connected it.
0168 | SPEAKER_1: Well, what about tanks?
0169 | SPEAKER_0: Where did you end up putting the tank? Is it back out there at the at the well, or is it somewhere else? Alright. They they haven't done that yet. So I don't so if we do make the connection, I do wanna just keep it shut off.
0170 | SPEAKER_0: But,
0171 | SPEAKER_0: you know, they're I'm trying they're building a little new well house. So
0172 | SPEAKER_0: what I wanted Robinson Well to tell me was, can you fit me a new tank
0173 | SPEAKER_0: in my little footprint of that new well house? Or and I said, and if if that's not what we wanna do, then let's put one in you know, I got two utility rooms that are essentially, you know, there for us to to put mechanicals and utilities. So in one of those basement rooms, that'd be fine too.
0174 | SPEAKER_1: Yes. Because we got that basement room, and we could put it in several places. I know we can put it over there by the water heater. It's not
0175 | SPEAKER_1: it it doesn't really matter where it's at. Well, I guess it depends on where Michael got a wire pulled, but even if he had to pull one over there, it's not that big a deal. So That's the thing. He's got yeah. He hadn't he's got
0176 | SPEAKER_0: he's got prepped to be able to run a new wire from the old warehouse.
0177 | SPEAKER_0: But if he had to pull a wire from that panel, there's no you know, the walls are wide open down there. It'd be just as easy to do it down there.
0178 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah.
0179 | SPEAKER_0: But what I tell the homeowner is is just let me simplify it for you instead of having one one tank under the old house, one tank, you know, somewhere else. Let's just do one tank somewhere before we start servicing the house. You know, we'll put a tank in somewhere along the beginning of that line and just, you know, call it good from there.
0180 | SPEAKER_1: Yes. And,
0181 | SPEAKER_1: and I guess we're gonna run the water the hot water
0182 | SPEAKER_1: off of that one
0183 | SPEAKER_1: tankless heater
0184 | SPEAKER_1: for both sides, or have we even considered it yet?
0185 | SPEAKER_0: I believe
0186 | SPEAKER_0: there's still a and it might be tankless. I think the way that because we didn't really mess with I guess, what we would have to find is the the new or the old main line that went into the old house. But my thought or my pros thought process was
0187 | SPEAKER_0: leave the old house the way it was. It might be a tankless in that little little
0188 | SPEAKER_0: crawl space that they have, or they might have a, you know, just a traditional water heater down there. But leave that all as it was, and then that that tankless that we have
0189 | SPEAKER_0: would only service the new
0190 | SPEAKER_0: the the new side.
0191 | SPEAKER_1: I gotcha. Alright. Because, yeah, I I wasn't sure about that either, what we was gonna do.
0192 | SPEAKER_1: But either way, we we make it work. But, yeah, I may have to go over there and spend a little time,
0193 | SPEAKER_1: one day this week, like I say, and see if we can get
0194 | SPEAKER_1: even if we just take the air compressor, hook it up,
0195 | SPEAKER_1: and see if we can make it pressurized. You know?
0196 | SPEAKER_0: Because Yeah. That's right.
0197 | SPEAKER_1: Because you know how it is. When we get ready to trim it, it's for some reason, you we can go years and not have to be finished with the house. And then about the time it's time to trim it out, hey, man. They they burn them up. We gotta be through next week. You know?
0198 | SPEAKER_0: Yeah. That's right. Well, that's what I figured is even if if you don't do all that much and you really just kind of look at everything, it'd probably be a good idea for us to just come up with a a plan so we know what we're doing when it comes time.
0199 | SPEAKER_1: I gotcha. But yeah. But,
0200 | SPEAKER_1: yeah. Because it you know, once they see it's close,
0201 | SPEAKER_1: they start making plans. You know? And I don't blame them. I would too. Dadgum
0202 | SPEAKER_1: it. You know? That's right.
0203 | SPEAKER_0: Yep.
0204 | SPEAKER_0: Yep. Yep.
0205 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah. Now, Malcolm, I don't think he likes miss Jenny. He wasn't too thrilled about going out there polishing pictures again, by the way.
0206 | SPEAKER_0: No. He wasn't too thrilled about it, but then he text me. I didn't go over there, but he text me and he said that that was the nicest she's ever been to him. So she must have been sweet to him, but I had to go over there not too long ago. Well, in the last freeze,
0207 | SPEAKER_0: you know, here's the thing about her. As much as she kicks and screams and is as mean as can be to us at times,
0208 | SPEAKER_0: she called me and she said, hey. Can you do you mind coming over either you or Jimmy and come showing me how to start a generator and and how I should what I should do if we lose power?
0209 | SPEAKER_0: So, you know, I'm not gonna be mean about it. So I said, yeah. Well, sure. We'll come over. So we went over and and, you know, showed her how to crank up a generator. And I said, well, you know, it it just she just had a little portable one. I said, you know, if you lose power, I said, all you all you're really gonna be able to do is get you a light and, you know, maybe some space heaters.
0210 | SPEAKER_0: But
0211 | SPEAKER_0: she, she was sweet as could be then, but she did tell me about Malcolm coming, and she said
0212 | SPEAKER_0: that
0213 | SPEAKER_0: she was contemplating
0214 | SPEAKER_0: making me and Malcolm buy there's two fixtures that she thought were
0215 | SPEAKER_0: tarnished maybe because of Malcolm's fingerprints.
0216 | SPEAKER_0: And she said, well, you or Malcolm should probably have to pay for these.
0217 | SPEAKER_0: And I'm thinking I didn't say nothing. I'm thinking there ain't no way I'm buying you a new fixture as many deals as I've cut for you. This is not gonna happen, but, you know
0218 | SPEAKER_1: You better be talking sweet to Malcolm, and I don't think Malcolm's buying a jack.
0219 | SPEAKER_1: I don't think he is either. So If it was he moved on wasn't for you.
0220 | SPEAKER_1: If not for you, he would have already told her.
0221 | SPEAKER_1: Look, honey. I'm done with you. I ain't fooling you no more. To hell with you. Yeah.
0222 | SPEAKER_1: But I think you're right.
0223 | SPEAKER_1: But I think he knows. If I do that, then, of course,
0224 | SPEAKER_1: you never know how that's gonna take it, and you hate to lose somebody that you don't work for. You know?
0225 | SPEAKER_0: Yeah. I think you might be right.
0226 | SPEAKER_1: But yes.
0227 | SPEAKER_1: No.
0228 | SPEAKER_0: Yeah.
0229 | SPEAKER_1: I guess I I can see Michael. Look. I'm tired of you. I'm I'm done.
0230 | SPEAKER_1: That's it. Yeah.
0231 | SPEAKER_0: I could I could I could see that too. I think he said things like that to me before,
0232 | SPEAKER_0: and you just kinda gotta let him,
0233 | SPEAKER_0: you know, get his venting out and and move on and let him calm down a little bit.
0234 | SPEAKER_1: Yes. Yep. That's the same way with,
0235 | SPEAKER_1: Rodney. He talked to me today, and he says, well, mister Everett, man, he's running me down the road about three weeks ago, and I figured it was over.
0236 | SPEAKER_1: And I says, well, he's done me that way a couple of times. And I figured that, and I said, once he gets it off his chest, he comes back a couple hours later, and life's good. He said, yeah. Today was just as nice as anybody I ever met.
0237 | SPEAKER_1: That's the way he is. And he he he don't wanna
0238 | SPEAKER_1: he he don't wanna hold no grudges. He wants to clear the air. We're done.
0239 | SPEAKER_1: That's over. That's right. We're moving on. Let's move on. He said, yeah. Man, I wish you'd warned me about that because I really thought that it was over.
0240 | SPEAKER_1: I said, no. I said Yeah.
0241 | SPEAKER_1: He he's just one of those fellows that I wanna I wanna go on and get it off my chest,
0242 | SPEAKER_1: and, and everything's good after that. It's almost like it didn't happen.
0243 | SPEAKER_0: That's right. But there's some people who are like that.
0244 | SPEAKER_1: But, you know, that's probably better than him being mad for six months about it. You know? Yeah. Just get it over and done. True.
0245 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah.
0246 | SPEAKER_1: Well, I done bought this temp and
0247 | SPEAKER_1: not bought it, but I have brought it home. And I'm looking at this this plumber and these ditches.
0248 | SPEAKER_1: I think I'm fixing to cover these ditches up and tap them before it gets dark.
0249 | SPEAKER_1: Alright. Well, sounds good.
0250 | SPEAKER_1: We'll we'll touch base Monday and see. And if it ain't too bad, like I say, I may run on over there and try to do some of that. I know I'm a do it sometime this week, go over there
0251 | SPEAKER_1: and and and address some of that stuff at Bethany Road. And like I said, it's close. So So we will not even do it.

0001 | SPEAKER_0: Hey, Randy.
0002 | SPEAKER_1: Hey, man.
0003 | SPEAKER_0: How are you?
0004 | SPEAKER_1: I'm doing good. I thought maybe you'd done put me on that list with that.
0005 | SPEAKER_0: Oh, no. It's not and he's off that list now, isn't he?
0006 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah. You know, for a while, you had him on that no no return call list. You know?
0007 | SPEAKER_1: And he he told me,
0008 | SPEAKER_1: If you if you talk to Zach, yeah, he won't call me back.
0009 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah. That's too funny. He's he's off that list. So
0010 | SPEAKER_1: He's doing good.
0011 | SPEAKER_1: No.
0012 | SPEAKER_1: What I was calling about, but I guess probably I don't know that I would do anything now. What about our horse barn over there, man? That's the only thing that I'm I'm a little bit worried about everything in that sunroof gun freezing up and busting. You know?
0013 | SPEAKER_0: Well, yeah, I had
0014 | SPEAKER_0: so here's what we did I guess, was it last weekend that we got all the ice? Yeah.
0015 | SPEAKER_1: Yes. It was cold last weekend too. Yeah. So what we did
0016 | SPEAKER_0: since the and then whatever that was, maybe three or four weeks ago when we got the other run of real cold weather,
0017 | SPEAKER_0: the guys ran around and they tie like, taped
0018 | SPEAKER_0: rock wool, and they they stapled down fiberglass. I mean, they wrapped every bit of exposed water line you could find.
0019 | SPEAKER_0: And then
0020 | SPEAKER_0: in addition, we have had that
0021 | SPEAKER_0: that,
0022 | SPEAKER_0: that well shut off. So, you know, we made it through last weekend okay.
0023 | SPEAKER_1: Yep.
0024 | SPEAKER_0: You know, I haven't gone back over there. They they had someone grind and seal
0025 | SPEAKER_0: the concrete floors.
0026 | SPEAKER_0: So and that was the past two days. So I haven't been over there, but I'm sure those boys used water.
0027 | SPEAKER_0: So it you know,
0028 | SPEAKER_0: it's
0029 | SPEAKER_0: probably not a bad idea to at least try and bleed any bit of water
0030 | SPEAKER_0: that's in there out, but but I'm, shoot, I'm halfway to Athens right now.
0031 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah. I mean, well, I'm down at Lake Oconee. I rented a tap, and I'm a try you know, I finally got the plumber in over there at the garage at my house, but he ever since he put it in, it's rained and kept the ditches full of water. So I he keeps pumping the water out.
0032 | SPEAKER_1: And, so I'm a try to get over there
0033 | SPEAKER_1: and
0034 | SPEAKER_1: fill that ditch up tonight and tamp it so that it don't fill up with water on the way again. You know?
0035 | SPEAKER_1: Right.
0036 | SPEAKER_1: But, yeah, I was just it it had crossed my mind, and I thought, man, I I don't know if Zach thought about it or not because it's you know, we're supposed to be called all weekend.
0037 | SPEAKER_0: No. And, you know, I didn't really think about it, and the only reason I haven't is because I made it through last weekend. Okay?
0038 | SPEAKER_0: And I know we do have everything wrapped in insulation, but, yeah, they say it's gonna get real cold.
0039 | SPEAKER_0: But
0040 | SPEAKER_0: I don't know. Do you believe it's gonna get I heard four inches of snow. I don't buy that for a minute.
0041 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah, man. For as long as you've lived in Georgia. Have you ever seen four inches of snow? Yeah. I mean, that ain't gonna happen. I just we might get an inch.
0042 | SPEAKER_1: I'm thinking we're getting two inches. I I I'm Yeah. I'm I'm I'm splitting the difference with them. I I'm gonna say they'll they'll get half what they predict.
0043 | SPEAKER_1: Yep.
0044 | SPEAKER_1: Yep. But So The part that worried me was that, you know, twenty four, forty eight hours below freezing. You know?
0045 | SPEAKER_1: Yep.
0046 | SPEAKER_1: Well, I I know.
0047 | SPEAKER_0: Jimmy said he wants to work tomorrow. Now I gotta call him and see if he really knows
0048 | SPEAKER_0: what he's up against, if he wants to work and there's snow on the ground.
0049 | SPEAKER_0: But if he does, you you know, I'll probably tell him to just go make rounds and make sure everybody's covered up and insulated good.
0050 | SPEAKER_1: But you think you think people have cut the well back off as they use water? What do you think? Maybe?
0051 | SPEAKER_0: Well, that's what I told them to do. Now these are not guys that I hired, so I haven't really gone back and checked because,
0052 | SPEAKER_0: you know, because I in in one way, I'm not really making any money on it, so I don't know that it's my responsibility. But I will call the homeowner. He I called him last Saturday and told him the same thing. I said, look. Everything is it's been covered with insulation, but,
0053 | SPEAKER_0: you know,
0054 | SPEAKER_0: beyond that, you know, you could either go put a drip on something or or,
0055 | SPEAKER_0: you know, just make sure that well shut off and open everything up and and just see what happens. But,
0056 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah. And he should be he'll be fine then, I don't think. But,
0057 | SPEAKER_1: I just really and truly.
0058 | SPEAKER_1: But, you know, it's not our place.
0059 | SPEAKER_1: Man, both of them little rooms, they ought to buy them a space heater and put in both of them rooms. You know what? Just I know.
0060 | SPEAKER_1: With a little thermostat.
0061 | SPEAKER_1: Well, I I bet I got a half a dozen of those things running here and there and everywhere. All my well sets have one in them.
0062 | SPEAKER_1: I got one out there in the pool bathroom.
0063 | SPEAKER_1: You know, I set it on low, and it comes on, you know, only if it gets really cold.
0064 | SPEAKER_1: You know?
0065 | SPEAKER_0: Yeah. I've
0066 | SPEAKER_0: yeah. I ran into Damon. I went over to, you know, my house over at the farm,
0067 | SPEAKER_0: I guess, whatever it was last Thursday night or last Friday, but it was late. I was surprised he was still out there. You know? It was 05:30, 06:00.
0068 | SPEAKER_0: And I don't think he could tell who it was, and I was walking through the field, and I hear him yell, hey.
0069 | SPEAKER_0: Hey.
0070 | SPEAKER_0: So
0071 | SPEAKER_0: I walked over to where he was. He was surprised as me. I said, well, I figured, you know, no one else is gonna put that heater in there. And,
0072 | SPEAKER_0: so I've let it rip in there since whatever. It's been running for the last week and a half.
0073 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah.
0074 | SPEAKER_1: That's it. I mean, I set mine on low and just when it comes on, it comes on.
0075 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah.
0076 | SPEAKER_1: Yep. Yeah.
0077 | SPEAKER_0: So Cool. Well, yeah, I'll probably call the guy just to make sure he's he's thinking about it too.
0078 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah. If he can go by and just make sure the breaker's flipped, but that's really all he's you know, it'd be odd Yeah. Yeah. Somehow, I would think.
0079 | SPEAKER_0: That's right. I mean, it works at least when when it warms up and we cut that well back on full time,
0080 | SPEAKER_0: maybe we will find a small leak. There actually is a really small leak
0081 | SPEAKER_0: somewhere in the line that runs
0082 | SPEAKER_0: from the wall up to that pressure tank
0083 | SPEAKER_0: up above on that little platform. Malcolm found it when they roughed in, but it's so small.
0084 | SPEAKER_0: You know, we had that well on for
0085 | SPEAKER_0: whatever, a week. I mean, think about it from the time you you ran that line
0086 | SPEAKER_0: till the time I had Malcolm come trim out, it ran all that time. And Malcolm
0087 | SPEAKER_0: came up to me when he was trimming out, and he said, hey. There's a little puddle of water, and he said, I really can't figure out what it's from. I said, well, probably someone spilled something.
0088 | SPEAKER_0: And then at the end of the day, he said, it's the smallest bit bigger.
0089 | SPEAKER_0: And I said, well, it's got there's probably just not so we've been cutting the well on and off
0090 | SPEAKER_0: only as we need it ever since then because I just figured when you came to do those waters, I'd tell you about it. So
0091 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah.
0092 | SPEAKER_1: But, and I went I went by your homestead up in Sparta
0093 | SPEAKER_1: either yesterday or day before.
0094 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah. And Malcolm, he he was up there, but then he was gonna go I think yesterday or today, he was gonna go see your girlfriend up in Spartan States.
0095 | SPEAKER_0: He was up there today.
0096 | SPEAKER_1: Okay. Well, I must have went out there yesterday.
0097 | SPEAKER_1: And Yeah. Because I had
0098 | SPEAKER_1: I didn't wanna dig up that pipe outside or well, let me rephrase that. I didn't wanna make the guys dig up that pipe outside, so I went out there and run that water line outside, you know, because
0099 | SPEAKER_1: once you shoot rock, I can't get back to it again. You know?
0100 | SPEAKER_1: Yep.
0101 | SPEAKER_1: And then for my toilets,
0102 | SPEAKER_1: this time,
0103 | SPEAKER_1: I stubbed out with copper,
0104 | SPEAKER_1: and I figured I can always tell those nice and silver. You know? Yeah. That's right. Find my sketches on where I can't you know, you just can't do that with that red and blue pecs. You know? Yeah. That's right.
0105 | SPEAKER_1: Yep. So one one day, we're gonna get something that's gonna work great.
0106 | SPEAKER_0: That's right.
0107 | SPEAKER_0: I still think that maybe with a little more care, those little
0108 | SPEAKER_0: those pre
0109 | SPEAKER_0: you know, they'll come ones that come with the stop on them.
0110 | SPEAKER_1: Yes.
0111 | SPEAKER_0: I think those are probably the best solution, but I think that
0112 | SPEAKER_0: I I just kinda let Jimmy and them run wild with those things. I think I might need to come up with a little
0113 | SPEAKER_0: system for them, and then maybe they you know, if I if I I gotta look at it and maybe, you know, mess around with one in the shop and and figure out the best way to put a piece of baseboard on around it.
0114 | SPEAKER_0: And,
0115 | SPEAKER_0: you know, I I those seem like they should be pretty slick.
0116 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah. They were pretty slick. It was just that, you know, every one of them, it seemed like the hole was either just a shade off or
0117 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah. I think the biggest thing too,
0118 | SPEAKER_1: is and I'm not sure how we're gonna rough it in where it works. When you rough them in and screw them to the studs, by the time you put sheetrock and that trim was extra thick that we used on that house.
0119 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah. So then little little little scratching threads didn't quite wanna reach to screw into the
0120 | SPEAKER_1: to screw into the other part. Yeah. Yeah. But and that may have just been that that trim was, you know, thicker than normal. You know? It was thick. That was, like, I think, full inch.
0121 | SPEAKER_0: Now the other thing would be is is do we use that and lay it out to where it's just above the baseboard
0122 | SPEAKER_0: and just have it come out of the sheetrock. Although some people might not like that, but still.
0123 | SPEAKER_1: Well, I kinda like it because it gets it up so high that you don't really even see it. You know? Right. Yep.
0124 | SPEAKER_0: That might not be a bad way to do it.
0125 | SPEAKER_1: But, yeah, if we if we did that, then I know we'd work out fine because baseball wouldn't matter, plus
0126 | SPEAKER_1: probably wouldn't have to be getting whole saws and trying I mean,
0127 | SPEAKER_1: it's pretty big project to try to hit that on.
0128 | SPEAKER_0: That is. Yep. And the SeaRock, man, I mean, even the
0129 | SPEAKER_1: go ahead. Because I, Yeah. I have got somebody that keeps calling me back to back to back. Can I can I take this and I'll holler back at you? Yeah. That's fine.
0130 | SPEAKER_1: Alright.
0131 | SPEAKER_1: Bye. Bye.

0003 | SPEAKER_0: Good. I'm right in the middle of setting up my Starlink.
0004 | SPEAKER_0: Oh, are you down at the barn? Yeah. I'm down here at the pole barn.
0005 | SPEAKER_0: Okay. I'm on my way out. Did those guys talk to you at all?
0006 | SPEAKER_0: Who? The drill the well guys.
0007 | SPEAKER_0: They said that they've gotten down to 300 feet, but they're gonna go deeper.
0008 | SPEAKER_0: Yeah. Well and she just called me and said that 500
0009 | SPEAKER_0: and only have a gallon a minute.
0010 | SPEAKER_0: I I'm gonna
0011 | SPEAKER_0: I'm I'm almost to the house. I'll see you in a minute, but we we probably get need around a point we need to make a call on.
0012 | SPEAKER_0: I don't think it makes sense to redrill somewhere, but we may wanna decide to hydrofrack it,
0013 | SPEAKER_0: which my understanding and we may wanna ask some questions to them, but
0014 | SPEAKER_0: my understanding is that's kind of a little bit more of a foolproof way when you get down that low to to get some decent amount of water. So Are you are you on your way over here?
0015 | SPEAKER_0: Yeah. I'll be there in, like, less than five minutes. I'm on Bethany Road. Okay. Thanks.

0023 | SPEAKER_1: But
0024 | SPEAKER_1: he said they're coming to staying tomorrow, and the boss told me that he would work Sunday if he needs to.
0025 | SPEAKER_1: And it sounds like we might need him to work on Sunday so we could all go to
0026 | SPEAKER_1: Winship on Monday. I don't think we're gonna travel,
0027 | SPEAKER_0: but, you know, I don't know. I mean, we're gonna get some snow. I don't know how much. Oh, yeah. Shoot. That's true. I I don't see how that was. We're gonna get snow. I just heard the weather. And, I mean, they're calling for the Watkinsville, Athens, Madison area. They're talking three to five inches.
0028 | SPEAKER_1: That's what I heard. But, man, when I look at the weather report or, like, on the app, it doesn't look that way. But, shoot, I I
0029 | SPEAKER_1: don't know. But yeah.
0030 | SPEAKER_1: We'll have to see. I mean,
0031 | SPEAKER_1: you know, with snow, the roads I'm not as much worried about the roads on Monday than I would be, like, with ice.
0032 | SPEAKER_0: Right. Except for the freezing temperatures, it ain't gonna get out of it ain't gonna get above 30 through Sunday.
0033 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah. That's why it's gonna hurt.
0034 | SPEAKER_1: Yep.
0035 | SPEAKER_1: So we'll just have to play it by a year.
0036 | SPEAKER_1: And Jimmy and David, I think, wanted to work tomorrow.
0037 | SPEAKER_0: Well, they got nothing set to do, and they'd have to go to Winship because they got nothing here to do.
0038 | SPEAKER_1: Yep.
0039 | SPEAKER_0: We're done. We're done till the electrician's finished. Unless
0040 | SPEAKER_0: those two windows come in and we get those set and you want me to get the siding guys on it, we can run side, and we're ready except for two windows and doors.
0041 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah. The only thing you'd need to which you can go ahead and call it in separately,
0042 | SPEAKER_1: but you'd need to get a house wrap inspection or ask that guy if he's gonna be okay with you taking pictures for a house wrap inspection.
0043 | SPEAKER_0: Okay. Alright.
0044 | SPEAKER_0: I didn't know that I didn't know that was an inspectable
0045 | SPEAKER_0: of of vehicle. I I didn't know. It's
0046 | SPEAKER_1: well, and in Hancock County, it might not be. But in Oconee and Morgan, it is. I think in some counties, it's not. So it's probably worth checking that out. I will. I'll call I'll call this call.
0047 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah.
0048 | SPEAKER_0: Ask him about that.
0049 | SPEAKER_1: Just tell Jimmy to call me

0051 | SPEAKER_1: Those boys just hit 500 feet, and they're only at a gallon a minute.
0052 | SPEAKER_0: Oh my god.
0053 | SPEAKER_0: So,
0054 | SPEAKER_1: you know, I gotta call Blanton and see,
0055 | SPEAKER_1: you know, what's gonna be the limit here. I mean, at this, my recommendation, you get to 500 feet.
0056 | SPEAKER_1: You might as well drill to 600. And then if we still don't got it, then we should crack the thing because
0057 | SPEAKER_1: it it ain't, you know
0058 | SPEAKER_1: moving and setting up and going another four or 500 feet, it's just not worth it. It's only, like, $3,535,100
0059 | SPEAKER_0: bucks, I think, and to frack it. And lifting it and everything is an issue as well. So I'm with you on that. I'm with you. Yeah.
0060 | SPEAKER_0: So,
0061 | SPEAKER_0: I'm
0062 | SPEAKER_0: Chad Chad come by, but he I forgot to give him my time card and my receipt. Do you want me to track him down on my way in?
0063 | SPEAKER_1: Yeah. If he'll respond to you. I don't know if he's pissed off at me for something, but I I don't know what I could've done to him. But he's I I can hardly get him to respond to me in a text message. I don't know what is going on with him.
0064 | SPEAKER_0: Well, I've been texting him a lot today because I had a lot of questions.

0068 | SPEAKER_0: He did tell me. Yes. He came eat, then he come by the house and looked at everything.
0069 | SPEAKER_0: And, you know, he I mean, he's like, how do you get these boys to do so much? I'm like, man, we're having a good time. I'm like, I just push them and they just do it. I'm like, the bigger challenge you give Jimmy, the more he works.
