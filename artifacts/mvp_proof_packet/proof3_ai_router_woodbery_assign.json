The contact, Anthony Cottrell, is a 'drifter' who works on 3-4 projects, so his identity is a weak signal. While the conversation mentions some construction details like 'Cypress install' and running something 'vertical', there are no strong anchors to confidently assign this to a specific project. The journal context also does not provide clear corroborating evidence. Given the ambiguity in the transcript, a review is warranted. deterministic_homeowner_override_gate: forced assign to homeowner project 7db5e186-7dda-4c2c-b85e-7235b67e06d8 (prev_decision=review, prev_project=null).",
