## LABELING NOTES FOR CHAD

1. **~45% of calls have no human_summary** — Chad will need to listen to transcript/audio for these.
2. **Stratum C is dominated by unattributed calls** — these are the hardest to label. Many have NULL contact and no project signal.
3. **Some calls appear in multiple strata** — the CSV has each call assigned to exactly one stratum, but some qualify for multiple (e.g., Woodbery Barns calls could be B or C).
4. **Shadow calls (cll_SHADOW*)** have no summaries and may have limited metadata.
5. **Permit jurisdiction data** not yet available for most calls (DATA-10 assignment pending).
