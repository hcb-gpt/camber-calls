-- Review-span extraction gap view
-- This view exposes review spans that are strong enough (confidence >= 0.70),
-- currently at review-gate, and not yet written into journal_claims.

-- Note: We intentionally DROP first because Postgres forbids CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW
-- from dropping columns. This migration changes the view's column shape vs the
-- earlier definition.
