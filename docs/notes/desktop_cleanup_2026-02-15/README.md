# Desktop cleanup notes bundle (archive)

Source: `/Users/chadbarlow/Desktop` (2026-02-15).

Purpose:
- Preserve working fix drafts + schema notes referenced during GT labeling and pipeline design.
- Preserve evaluation inputs (GT CSVs, proofsets, anchor catalogs) in GitHub.

This is an archive drop; treat contents as drafts unless/ until implemented.
