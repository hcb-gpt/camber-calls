-- Fix no_double_covered gate logic per DATA-1 analysis
--
-- ISSUE: Gate was flagging 79 legitimate spans where:
--   - ai-router decided decision='review'
--   - Created span_attribution with needs_review=true
--   - Created review_queue item with status='pending'
--   Both existing together IS THE EXPECTED STATE for review spans.
--
-- FIX: Only flag as "double covered" when:
--   - Attribution is RESOLVED (needs_review=false)
--   - But review_queue is still pending
--
-- This catches the actual bug (stale review items not cleaned up after resolution)
-- without flagging legitimate review-pending spans.
