-- PR-4: Review queue span wiring
-- Adds span_id for idempotent span-level review items
-- Creates v_review_queue_spans view as product surface
--
-- Source: DATA_STRAT_20260130T0810Z_pr4_review_queue_view_and_schema.sql

begin;

-- 1) Add span_id column to review_queue (if missing)
alter table public.review_queue add column if not exists span_id uuid;

-- 2) Create unique index on span_id for idempotent upserts
-- (allows multiple NULL span_id rows for legacy items)
create unique index if not exists review_queue_span_id_uq
  on public.review_queue (span_id)
  where span_id is not null;

-- 3) Add index for status + created_at ordering
create index if not exists review_queue_status_created_idx
  on public.review_queue (status, created_at desc);

-- 4) Product surface view: review items joined to spans + latest attribution
