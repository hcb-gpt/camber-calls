-- Idempotent: uses ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING and conditional updates.

-- Step 1: Backfill scoring log from existing interactions
INSERT INTO contact_scoring_log (contact_id, interaction_id, transcript_chars, scored_at)
SELECT
  i.contact_id,
  i.interaction_id,

WHERE i.contact_id IS NOT NULL

-- Step 2: Recalculate correct stats from actual data
WITH correct_stats AS (
